Hello, Iâ€™m Anthony

I started coding for fun, and I learn by myself, only in Python for now. I'm into data and back end dev but I want to make complete projects so I also do some front end (just a little bit)

I'm currently working on various Django projects to deploy online. I want to get better with APIs and deployment processes.

I'm currently working on a fun website where users can vote on clothing articles. The next project will be a data visualisation website using ourworldindata.org as a reference.
