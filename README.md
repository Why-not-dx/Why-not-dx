Hello, Iâ€™m Anthony or @Why-not-dx because I want to always be up for some new project,
so why not jump into it right ? 

âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

ðŸ€„ I started coding for fun after getting into basic VBA for work. I naturally got into Python for the simplicity of it and for it's ability to script and handle data for my job. 
I'm focusing data management with SQL and python modules like Pandas and Numpy for now 
But I don't want to limit myself to that so I keep an eye on HTML, Java and C++ so I can work on bigger projects soon. 

ðŸ€„ I would obviously love to make a job out of it one day, but let's keep it simple for now !

I can't wait to learn some more...
